# Order Conditions for NSARK Methods

In this repository, there is the code used for the work on deriving a comprehensive theory for analyzing the order of convergence for non-standard additive Runge-Kutta (NSARK) methods. In principle, the theory allows to formulate order conditions up to any order, however, to obtain solely solution-dependent conditions more effort is needed. As two examples, the known order conditions for MPRK schemes from [Kopect and Meister (2nd Order)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168927417301861?via%3Dihub), [Kopecz and Meister (3rd Order)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10543-018-0705-1) and GeCo methods from [Martiradonna et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168927419303368) were derived and expanded up to order 4. 

The computation of the Gröbner bases is in the [Maple notebook](Gröbner_basis_computation.mw)
